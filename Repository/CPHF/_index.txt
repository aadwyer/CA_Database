All CPHFs from Erin Lanus personal communication.
The list of included CPHFS is a work in progress.

*Note* The compact form of the CPHFs are a representation
of the CPHFs where each symbol "i" represents the ith 
vector from the list of all vectors from U sorted lexicographically. 

We plan to change this to be consistent with the reverse lexicographic
ordering described in the paper.
